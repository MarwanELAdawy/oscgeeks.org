            <h2> Laravel PHP Framework </h2>
            <p>Awesome and experienced web developers found a repeating pattern in the process of creating web applications. They know very well that a real programmer should not repeat his code over and over again. And so they created a group of libraries and tools that contained code they used across their websites; they called it Laravel.</p>

    <h3> MVC Design Pattern</h3>

    <p>These developers knew very well how to write code that is clean, beautiful and -most importantly- decoupled. They used a group of really beautiful design patterns, most notably: the MVC design pattern to decouple logic, data access and presentation layers.</p>

    <h3>Open Source! and Very Well-Documented</h3>

    <p>We are the Open Source Community after all right? It is free as in free speech, the code is very well-written and commented, and the documentation is terrific!</p>
